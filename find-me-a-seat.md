# Find Me A Seat

# 1. Introduction
Find Me A Seat is an Android app which allows students to book seats at university buildings.
This project is the result of an university assignment and was designed and implemented by a group of four students, including me. 
The main goals of this assignment were to:
- Analyse the relevant scientific literature and existing solutions for seat booking on mobile devices
- Perform user, task and context analyses
- Create four low-fidelity prototypes
- Choose the best low-fidelity prototype by polling potential users and turn it into a high-fidelity prototype
- Poll users about the usability of the high-fidelity prototype and improve the usability accordingly
