# Project portfolio
This repository contains documentation about a selection of the most interesting, non-commercial projects I was part of.
Each markdown file describes a particular project and also contains instructions for starting a demo and exploring the applications.

Here's a list of the available projects:
- [Money In Money Out](https://github.com/AlexanderBiskup/project-portfolio/blob/master/MONEY_IN_MONEY_OUT.md) (Web app, Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, MongoDB)

If you encounter any problems or have any questions, feel free to contact me (alexander.biskup.at@gmail.com).
